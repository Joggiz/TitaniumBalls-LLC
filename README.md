Summary:

Rough volatility:

- rough Bergomi model
- rough Heston model
- SABR model

Pricing rough volatility by Monte Carlo:
- We use a neural network calibrated implied volatility surface for the rough volatility (Bergomi) model.
- Our rough volatility model speeds up the calculation by 20 000-35 000 times compared to the monte carlo model.
- we can calibrate many paremiters fast --> aproximate many models at the same time
  * Train the generator on several models at the same time (Heston, Bergomi, SABR) in Monte Carlo experiments as before.
  * Calibrate several models at hte same time -> determine the best-fit model to a given data (flag).
  * Controlled experiments: train on both Bergomi and Heston -> test on data generated by Heston.

Lets try to build these models for commodity contracts!
